## UX

- The design for Final Project 4 was created as a series of wireframes covering mobile, tablet and desktop to determine the initial design and layout of the site.
- Final Project 4 is designed to be simple and easy to navigate using standard user conventions for ecommerce websites.
- The applications display the homepage, view products pages, product details pages and the shopping basket.

### Colour Scheme

- I decided to go with a clean and crisp colour scheme with a white background using black as the main colour for text/icons and a teal to provide a pop of colour to the screen.
- The colours used are as follows:-

- `#ffffff` used for primary text and buttons.
- `#000000` used for the background and secondary text.
- `#0ababd` used for banner and other details.

I have used CSS `:root` variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.

```css
:root {
    --teal: #0ababd;
    --black: #000;
    --white: #fff;
}
```

### Typography

- I used the Google Fonts called 'Baskervville SC' and 'Raleway' for the Luxe Jewellery website.

- [Baskervville SC](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Baskervville+SC) was used for the main text on the site such as the navbar.
- [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) was used for product, product/details and shopping bag pages.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used in the Final Project 4 site.
