# Testing
The testing approach(described in detail in this testing readme) is as follows:
1. Automated unit testing using the Django unit test framework
2. Manual testing using emulators and real devices

## Unit testing information
- I wrote a number of unit tests(65) using the Django unit test framework
- These test cases are structured in a number of suites(13)
- A TDD(Test Driven development) approach was used for writing unit tests, where the test was written as and before the view was written, and the test passed as the view method
was written/developed
- The structure of the unit test is based on the model/form/view structure, for example test_views.py, test_model.py and test_forms.py on a per-app basis
- I used coverage(coverage.py) for code coverage and to ensure a high code coverage was met on all python files in the project
- An overall report image is available at the following link [Coverage Report](readme/misc/coverage_full_report.png)
- To run the unit tests click on Run "Test with Coverage" in your IDE, or at the command line "python manage.py test"
<br>![Unit test run 1](readme/misc/unit_test1.PNG)
- A test database is created and deleted for the test run, and each suite has a set-up:<code>def setUp(self):</code> and teardown:<code>def tearDown(self):</code> methods to create 
the relevant objects needed for the test suite
<br>![Unit test run 2](readme/misc/unit_test2.PNG)

### Unit testing information for the Bag app
- For the bag app one suite was written to test the views
- The bag app does not have any forms or models
- The views' suite contains 8 unit tests testing add/removing items from the bag
<br>![Suite](readme/unit_tests/bag_test_views.PNG)
- In terms of coverage when run as part of the 13 suites, it gives the following code coverage
<br>![Coverage](readme/unit_tests/bag_coverage.PNG)

### Unit testing information for the Checkout app
- For the checkout app three suites were written to test the views, form and models
- The suites contain 3 unit tests testing the order creation and forms
<br>![Suite](readme/unit_tests/checkout_suites.PNG)
- In terms of coverage when run as part of the 13 suites, it gives the following code coverage
<br>![Coverage](readme/unit_tests/checkout_coverage.PNG)

### Unit testing information for the Favourites app
- For the favourites' app two suites were written to test the views and models
- The favourites' app does not have any forms
- The two suites contain 8 unit tests testing adding and removing favourites
<br>![Suite](readme/unit_tests/favourites_suites.PNG)
- In terms of coverage when run as part of the 13 suites, it gives the following code coverage
<br>![Coverage](readme/unit_tests/favourites_coverage.PNG)

### Unit testing information for the Home app
- For the home app one suite was written to test the views
- The home app does not have any forms or models
- The suite contains 1 unit tests testing the home page template
<br>![Suite](readme/unit_tests/home_test_views.PNG)
- In terms of coverage when run as part of the 13 suites, it gives the following code coverage
<br>![Coverage](readme/unit_tests/home_coverage.PNG)

### Unit testing information for the News app
- For the news app two suites were written to test the views and models
- The forms are tested as part of these suites
- The two suites contain 17 unit tests testing add/modify/views and delete of news items and comments
<br>![Suite](readme/unit_tests/news_suites.PNG)
- In terms of coverage when run as part of the 13 suites, it gives the following code coverage
<br>![Coverage](readme/unit_tests/news_coverage.PNG)

### Unit testing information for the Products app
- For the product's app two suites were written to test the views and models
- The forms are tested as part of these suites
- The two suites contain 24 unit tests testing add/modify/views and delete of reviews and products
<br>![Suite](readme/unit_tests/products_suites.PNG)
- In terms of coverage when run as part of the 13 suites, it gives the following code coverage
<br>![Coverage](readme/unit_tests/products_coverage.PNG)

### Unit testing information for the Profile app
- For the product's app two suites were written to test the views and models
- The forms are tested as part of these suites
- The two suites contain 4 unit tests testing the users profile and profile updates
<br>![Suite](readme/unit_tests/profiles_suites.PNG)
- In terms of coverage when run as part of the 13 suites, it gives the following code coverage
<br>![Coverage](readme/unit_tests/profiles_coverage.PNG)

# Bugs found during the testing phase

Bug no. | Bug description |  Bug fix |
------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
1 | When running html validation, sales_items had same id as news, | The fix was to give both a unique id (main-nav.html)
2 | When running html validation, alt text for a number of images in a loop was the same | The fix was the set it to the product name (products.html) |
3 | If a user has 0 favourites, pagination setup call in the view is being called even though there are no items | The fix was to move the location of the pagination setup call(util.py) |
4 | Ths stripe webhook was not working on production. I had the same secret set on heroku and local development, even though I had two different webhooks defined(development and production) |The fix was to set the correct webhook secret as an environment variable in Heroku
5 | The following error was displayed in logs "norderedObjectListWarning: Pagination may yield inconsistent results with an unordered object_list: <class 'products.models.Product'> QuerySet."| The fix was to update the product and review models to order by id (models.py in Product app)
6 | Combining filtering and pagination does not include the filter text in the pagination page link | Fix was to implement a product_tools template tags from https://www.caktusgroup.com/blog/2018/10/18/filtering-and-pagination-django/
7 | The news item count on the news page was incorrect as it included draft and published in its count | The fix was to update the filter to only include published items <code>News.objects.filter(status=1).count()</code>
8 | On a mobile device the pagination on the products page was overlapping over the div | The fix was to set the flex wrap class <code>flex-wrap: wrap</code>
9 | If items are greater than four, the product, sale, favourites page with pagination doesnt scale right | Update the bootstrap class html to <code>col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6 col-xl-3</code>
10 | Reviews were not displaying the latest first | The fix was to filter the reviews in the query by <code>order_by('-create_date')</code>
11 | Products were not sorting by rating | The fix was to change the update statement to filter on the id, then update <code>Product.objects.filter(id=product.id).update(rating=average_rating_rounded)</code>
12 | The product rating was different on paginated product review pages | The fix was to display product.rating, not the average_rating as it was being calculated per paginated page and not per product
